    <p>
        I was born in Guyana, and lived in the US since I was seven. I was raised in Far Rockaway, and now    live in Astoria, (and yes, mind-throbbing culture change). I traveld around the East Cost, and realized I would now rather live anywhere else than NYC--due to high population of people and most people are rude as can be. 
    <br>
    I have a degree in Criminal Justice and Information Technology Management; I had many different careere paths,and giving that most was a "Are You Kidding Me", I decided my safest path now is sticking strictly to technology. I loved technology since I was a child, and am now pursuing a career in Software Engineering... yay me ;}</p>
